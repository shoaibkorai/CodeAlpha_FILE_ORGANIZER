# CodeAlpha Python Internship Task 2

🚀 Excited to share that I have successfully completed my second task at CodeAlpha Python Internship! 💼💻 Added bonus: Check out this Python script I built that automatically organizes files in a directory based on their types! 📂

🔍 Tired of manually sorting through your messy files? Say no more! This script utilizes the power of Python's `os` and `shutil` libraries to effortlessly categorize your files into neat folders for Images, Documents, Videos, and Audios.

👨‍💻 Whether you're a busy professional or a tech enthusiast, this script will save you valuable time and keep your files neatly organized. Simply input the directory path, sit back, and watch the magic happen!

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the script by providing the directory path where you want to organize files.
3. Sit back and let the script do the work for you!
